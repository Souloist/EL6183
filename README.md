Digital signal processing lab </b>

========================
Real-time implementation of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms, with an emphasis on audio signal processing and audio effects. Implementation will be done in python.

Topics include: Audio input-output and buffering. Filtering (recursive and non-recursive filters, structures).
Fast Fourier transform and windowed spectral analysis. Digital audio effects (delay line, amplitude modulation,
reverberation, distortion, phase vocoder). Time-varying and adaptive filters.
